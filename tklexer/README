To install the Toknot Lexer to Pygments, run:

	sudo python setup.py install

Confirm with

	pygmentize -L
	

You should see in the lexer output:

* tk, toknot:
    Toknot (filenames *.html, *.css, *.php, *.xml, *.static)

You will need to run setup.py and install the tklexer package anytime after tklexer/tklexer.py is updated

NOTE: Depending on how you installed Sphinx and Pygments,
you may be installing to the wrong version. 
If you need to install to a different version of python
specify its path when using setup.py, e.g.:

	sudo /usr/bin/python2.5 setup.py install
